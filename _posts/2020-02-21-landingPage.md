title: Creating a Project Landing Page - in progress

Building a landing page using Bootstrap4. Starting with template from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) website. This is mostly a refresher, but it's been a long time since I've touched any of this. Most customization options are documented on the Bootstrap site for convenience.

**Creating a Navigation Bar**

Define the `nav class`, specify what your buttons will look like; create `<div>` and `<ul>` classes within each other to hold your list of links. Each link within the navbar is its own item.

---

**The Jumbotron**

Section named `top` for nav purposes. Contains page title, minor descriptive flavor text, important links (like where to get a product).

---

**Sections**

Each block of the page is contained within a `<section>`. Each section gets a class for navigation purposes.

**something else i guess**
