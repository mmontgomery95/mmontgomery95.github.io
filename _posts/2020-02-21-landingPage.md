title: Creating a Project Landing Page

Building a landing page using Bootstrap4. Starting with template from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) website. This is mostly a refresher, but it's been a long time since I've touched any of this. Most customization options are documented on the Bootstrap site for convenience.

**Creating a Navigation Bar**

Define the `nav class`, specify what your buttons will look like; create `<div>` and `<ul>` classes within each other to hold your list of links. Each link within the navbar is its own item.

---

**Sections**

Each block of the page is contained within a `<section>`. Each section gets a class for navigation purposes. Sections used for this project include jumbotron, description, features

**Jumbotron**
-   `top` in navigation
-   Contains page title, descriptive flavor text, and important links

**Description**
-   What is this project?
-   Overview of what the project is and does

**Features**
-   Contains a few key features of the product
-   Each feature contains a _read more_ to keep the page clean


---

**Cards**

-   Each card uses a very large block of code
-   Looks nice, handy, but hard to find anything within the code
-   Great for short lists (i.e. pricing info)



Beyond that point, most additions were cosmetic and CSS-based.

**Things to come back to**

Items that were covered in the tutorials used, but didn't pertain to the project:
-   Adding videos
-   Carousel
-   Review blurbs
-   User input (i.e. newsletters)
I'd like to come back to these when I have free time to put together one large website project for the sake of knowing how to do these things.
