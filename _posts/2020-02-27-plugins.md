title: Plugins  -   IN PROGRESS
date: 2020-02-27

Making sense of the currently created plugins for this project.
From there, implementing the `file_data_source` plugin (I believe).

***

__-Files-__

`__init__.py`
-   function: *???*
-   *empty???*
-   Further investigation implies this will hold the plugin info as it runs, presumably from defining the function `__init__(self)`, likely the `super().__init__()` command within it. Will confirm.

***

`data_source.py`
-   creates `Datasource` class containing following functions: `__init__`, `migrate`, `create`, `clean`, `persist`; does not define these functions
-   class is imported in following plugin files to create various data sources (file, HTTP, web)
-   *difference between http and web???*

***

`file_data_source.py`, `http_data_source.py`, `web_data_source.py`
-   creates class which calls `super().__init__()` to unknown results
-   context tells me each class creates the related data source, but not sure how

***

`app.py`
-   Following logic, should call on these files; only calls `user_plugins` file, which does not contain all plugins *(possibly implementing others as we go?)*
-   Creates `load_plugins` function
-   *How are the others reached???*
-   Tried to run file; received custom error message: "EnvValidationError: Environment variable "DEBUG" not set"
-   Running the file puts content into `__init__,py`; *how???*

***

__Key Terms__
-   `self`    -   refers to the current instance of an object
-   `super()`   -   calls inherited methods from a parent or sibling class
