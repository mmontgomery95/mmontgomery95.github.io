title: Plugins  -   IN PROGRESS

Making sense of the currently created plugins for this project.

__Files__

`__init__.py`
-   function: *???*
-   *empty???*

`data_source.py`
-   creates `Datasource` class containing following functions: `__init__`, `migrate`, `create`, `clean`, `persist`; does not define these functions
-   class is imported in following plugin files to create various data sources (file, HTTP, web)
-   *difference between http and web???*

`file_data_source.py`, `http_data_source.py`, `web_data_source.py`
-   creates class which calls super().__init__() to unknown results
-   context tells me each class creates the related data source, but not sure how

`app.py`
-   Following logic, should call on these files; only calls `user_plugins` file, which does not contain all plugins
-   *How are the others reached???*
-   Tried to run file; received errors
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 15, in <module>
    DEBUG = env.bool("DEBUG")
  File "/home/mlmont/.asdf/installs/python/3.8.1/lib/python3.8/site-packages/environs/__init__.py", line 74, in method
    raise EnvValidationError('Environment variable "{}" not set'.format(source_key), [message])
environs.EnvValidationError: Environment variable "DEBUG" not set
```

__Key Terms__
-   `self`    -   refers to the current instance of an object
-   `super()`   -   calls inherited methods from a parent or sibling class
