title: Plugins  -   IN PROGRESS

Making sense of the currently created plugins for this project.
From there, implementing the `file_data_source` plugin (I believe).

***

__-Files-__

`__init__.py`
-   Constructor which tells python that the directory is a module

***

`data_source.py`
-   creates `Datasource` class containing following functions: `__init__`, `migrate`, `create`, `clean`, `persist`; currently stubs, will add methods later
-   class is imported in following plugin files to create various data sources (file, HTTP, web)

***

`file_data_source.py`, `http_data_source.py`, `web_data_source.py`
-   creates classes which call `super().__init__()` - inherits methods from `constructor` class
-   context tells me each class creates the related data source, but not sure how

***

`app.py`
-   Following logic, should call on these files; only calls `user_plugins` directory, which does not contain all plugins *(possibly implementing others as we go?)*
-   Loops over `user_plugins` directory, loads and evaluates them, then calls indicated method on them
-   Creates `load_plugins` function
-   Tried to run file; received custom error message: "EnvValidationError: Environment variable "DEBUG" not set"
-   Running the program calls on `__init__.py`, thereafter containing all relevant arguments

***

__Key Terms__
-   constructor -   special type of method used to initialize instance members of a class
-   `self`      -   refers to the current instance of an object
-   `super()`   -   calls inherited methods from a parent or sibling class
-   `self.eager`-   *???*   

***

__*Questions*__
-   scripts within `/bin` (i.e. `run_ingest`)
-   Dockerfiles
