title: Publishing Changes to the Site
date: 2020-01-30

Minor documentation, mostly for my own purposes, of various commands used to create and publish changes to this site.

```
jekyll build
jekyll b
```
- Builds my site

```
jekyll serve
jekyll s
```
- Builds site for local viewing; preview what changes will look like without actually publishing

```
git status
```
- Shows the files which have been changed but not yet committed to github

```
git commit -a -m
```
- Commits files to the repository, with message for documentation

```
git push
```
- Send local changes in current branch to its remote counterpart


Next on the docket: visuals. The current beast of burden is attempting to change the theme that was initially set; the decision must be made whether to set an entirely new theme, or customize the CSS of the current theme to my liking.
