Step one: running python3 instead of python2.

```
alias python=python3
```
Step one complete.

Next: Creating and cloning the git repository. Creating is straightforward; clone using following command:

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME.git
```

- sudo grants permission to run the command
- URL retrieved from "clone repository" option in browser
- make sure correct directory is set before running command
- permissions must be set for directory before work is able to be done within it

Install Flask
- "framework for Python to develop web applications"
- later: check out Django, potential alternative to Flask

Done:
- can get a "Hello World" on server
- basic database created
- created function to establish connection w/ database & execute insert query

Next:
- make first module run correctly. Syntax errors galore; not functioning even after copy/pasting code from site
