title: About Me
---

My name is Morgan Montgomery; I will be using this blog to track my progress 
(as well as provide documentation for projects) as I learn and grow as a programmer. 
Currently I have experience with Java, HTML, and CSS, and I'm working to add Python to that list 
as well.

Current goals:
- Complete a functional Python project
- Become proficient with Linux
- Dust off the CSS skills
