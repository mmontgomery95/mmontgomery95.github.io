<p>
My name is Morgan Montgomery; I will be using this blog to track my progress 
(as well as provide documentation for projects) as I learn and grow as a programmer. 
Currently I have experience with Java, HTML, and CSS, and I'm working to add Python to that list 
as well.
</p>

Current goals:<br>

-  Complete a functional Python project<br>
-  Become proficient with Linux<br>
-  Learn to effectively use Github<br>
-  Dust off the CSS skills
