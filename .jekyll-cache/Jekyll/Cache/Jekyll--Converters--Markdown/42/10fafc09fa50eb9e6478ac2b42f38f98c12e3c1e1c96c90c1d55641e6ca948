I"<p>Using the same base code/files, the Todo Flask app now works for PostgreSQL using pysopg2.</p>

<p>Key changes/differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrote a function to run a query, rather than writing the same few lines inside each function within the helper file</li>
  <li>String arguments must be indicated with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%s</code>, whereas previously <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code> was used</li>
  <li>SQLite allowed for a simple path specification; psycopg2 needed a much more specific path laid out</li>
  <li>psycopg2 requires the connection to be closed when you’re finished with it</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time on this project was spent debugging, as a majority of the code was already written and ready to go with the SQLite app- most, if not all, changes were done within the helper file. The major takeaway was to insert <code class="highlighter-rouge">print()</code> lines throughout the code to determine where exactly the issues were, as the terminal didn’t always specify.</p>
